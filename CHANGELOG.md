## [Unreleased]

### critic-loop extensions (deferred from 2026-04-19 prior-art review)

- **Devil's Advocate** as a 5th parallel critic (forces construction of the
  strongest case *against* the manuscript's position). Revisit after seeing
  4-critic loop performance.
- **Traceability matrix** for iteration 2+ — feed each critic a diff since
  its prior iteration plus its own prior unresolved issues, to verify
  substantive fixes rather than cosmetic rewrites.

### Potential improvements (deferred prior-art)

- **Marker** (GPL-3.0) — LLM-assisted PDF extraction for CID-font garbling.
  Integrate via subprocess CLI only (not import) to preserve MIT licensing.
  Candidate fallback in `scripts/core/pdf_extract.py` when both pdfplumber and
  pypdf fail the quality score.
- **paperscraper** (MIT) — Wiley + Elsevier TDM + bioRxiv + PMC BioC-XML.
  Partial overlap with `scripts/pipelines/attach_pdfs.py`; integration would
  require rewriting the orchestration layer. Defer until we have evidence the
  simplification is worth the churn.
- **grobid-client-python**, **semanticscholar** PyPI, **Europe PMC** — minor
  code-quality wins.
- **`/add-publisher`** scaffold skill — generate `publishers/<name>.py` stub
  from DOI prefix + login-required + CF-required inputs.

## [0.1.0] — TBD

Initial public release. See README for the full feature set.
